Array List 

----------------------------------------Best to go with Array----------------------------( resizeable we have to pay some cost)
------the best example of this is the when ArrayList is Become small then the bigger ArrayList is created and all element is coppied 
there---this all proccess is internally-- and old array will be deallocath garbage collection------- Preformance is decresea in 
Collection--

Why We are using ?
to reference many object (varible) wer need to declare many varible Handling task is going to be very handy.By Use of ArrayList we can 
reference many object by a single variable.

Limitation of Array
Fixed in Size
1.Sized in Size (Not dynamic) Not resize we cannot create new element of array at run time.there may be a case of memory loss.
----2---
Homogenous data element can be represent by array.

i want to store any type of array 
but this works always Object class is super class.
Object A[10];
A[0] = new Student();
A[1] = new Boy();
etc.

--3---
underline data structure.
readymat function is not for array.
\\  contains function in Collection

Collection can not hold primitive data type but support the object type
Array supprot both


overcum these problem we have use collection
1. Growable in Nature
2. can hold  homogenous + heterogouns 
3. Based on standard Data structure ()
